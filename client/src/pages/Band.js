    <h2>About the band</h2>
    <p>Dead to the Core is Sam Bouve (Bass), Sean Galbraith (Guitar), Reilly Somach (Drums), and Phil Todisco (Guitar & Pedal Steel). This collective of North Shore original artists, songwriters, and producers came together in 2020 to honor the timeless catalog of the Grateful Dead with a fresh and innovative approach. Dead to the Core celebrates Jerryâ€™s spirit with inspired playing, infused with unrestrained improvisations, and a real good time.

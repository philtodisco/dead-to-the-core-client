**Dead To The Core Band Website**

This is a website for my band Dead To The Core. The website allows you to view our tour dates and additional info such as location, ticket links, date, etc, which is fetched from an API that I built ([API Repo](https://github.com/philtodisco/DTTC-api)). In addition to the tour dates, users can send us an email via our contact form which is also powered by the backend that I built. Users are also able to navaigate to an "about" page to learn more about the band, and navigate to our social media websites. Lastly, a mobile version is activated using media queries making the website fully responsive across all devices.
